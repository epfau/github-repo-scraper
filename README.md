# github-repo-scraper

This is a repository I made as part of a final project for a class.  The goal of this final project is to create a web scraping tool that can be deployed on minishift. I am using this repo as a test to see what happens. I am also initializing this repository with a README and adding a Python .gitignore to see what happens.
